**Abstract:** Breast cancer has continued to be a significant health issue in recent years, being the most frequently  diagnosed cancer among women in the United States. Early-stage breast cancer lacks apparent symptoms  in the early stage of breast cancer; thus, many patients miss the best chance to cure it. Breast Ultrasound  (BUS) imaging has emerged as a crucial diagnostic tool. Yet, the inherent challenges in BUS imaging, such  as low contrast and noise, impede accurate breast cancer diagnosis by doctors. Computer-aided-diagnosis  (CAD) systems are proposed to help radiologists interpret BUS images, make a more precise diagnosis, and  reduce their workload. Breast cancer detection plays a crucial role in the CAD system. Training a fully  supervised model for detecting breast cancer necessitates many manual annotations. Several weakly  supervised frameworks for object detection have been developed to minimize the requirement for extensive  annotations. During the SpF 2023 award period, the research team developed two such frameworks for  natural images and breast cancer detection. However, trustworthiness is the most critical aspect of smart  health applications. Constructing a trustworthy deep-learning model requires extensive datasets.  Additionally, previous methods do not offer a qualitative assessment of the models' trustworthiness. To  overcome these hurdles, the researchers propose a new, trustworthy, weakly supervised framework for  breast cancer detection named BUSwiNet. This framework utilizes only image-level labels (cancer/non cancer). It is capable of identifying the bounding boxes of breast tumors in breast ultrasound (BUS) images,  as well as determining whether the tumor is cancerous. Moreover, the research aims to develop a method  using Bayesian Neural Networks to evaluate the trustworthiness of breast cancer detection models  quantitatively.

**Objective:** The project is focused on two primary objectives: 1) to develop an innovative weakly supervised  framework for breast cancer detection named BUSwiNet. 2) to employ Bayesian Theory to evaluate the  trustworthiness of BUSwiNet and the models developed during the SpF 2023 period to identify the most  reliable model. Furthermore, in response to the growing interest in AI and smart health, the research team  intends to establish a summer learning environment for three undergraduate students. It is designed to spark  their interest in AI and healthcare and prepare them for future careers.

**Significance and expected outcomes:** The importance of this project lies in several key areas: Firstly, it  is expected to not only increase the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis but also has the potential to be  adapted for other types of cancers, such as lung and brain cancers. Secondly, the method for estimating  trustworthiness could provide a strategy applicable across various contexts. Thirdly, this project offers an  excellent opportunity to mentor undergraduate students in my initial year as a faculty member at Kean  University, engaging in research collaboration with students and enhancing faculty-student relationships.  The expected research outputs include 1) our proposed BUSwiNet to outperform existing methods on  three public BUS datasets and 2) a publicly available software tool for breast cancer detection and  trustworthiness evaluation, 3) three peer-reviewed papers: two conference papers addressing objective  one and a journal article focusing on objective 2.
